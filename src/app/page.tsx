            <p>
                Welcome to a college cross country and track and field simulation game! My goal is to provide an
                engaging experience for all running enthusiasts.
            </p>
            <p>
                The game is currently in development and is a work in progress.
                I am constantly adding new features and improving the game. I hope you enjoy the game and feel free to
                provide feedback!
