# Sim Game

Sim Game is a sports simulation web application inspired by games like *Basketball-GM* and *Out of the Park Baseball*. It focuses on managing and simulating university-level **track & field** and **cross country** teams. Players recruit athletes, train them, and compete in events to achieve victory through strategic team management. (title of the project is a WIP, as is the game.)

## Features

1. **Dynamic Seasons and Playoffs**
   - Simulate cross country and track & field events over the span of multiple seasons, including a realistic playoff schedule. 
   - Dynamic schedules with randomly generated meets and participant results.
   - Goals: make schedules, and race results be more realistic and life-like.
   - Goals: Allow player ratings to influence race results

2. **Team and Player Management**
   - Goals: Allow the recruiting high school athletes to join your university team.
   - Goals: Allow holding tryouts, managing practice schedules, workouts, etc.
   - Allow better UI for users to see their team statistics better

3. **Realistic Scoring Systems**
   - Cross country: Top 5 finishers contribute to team scores. If a team doesn't have 5 racers, the team gets zero points, and players don't contribute to scoring system.
   - Track & field: Points awarded by placement for top 6 participants.

4. **Interactive Player Profiles**
   - Randomly generated cartoon faces for players using [faces.js](https://github.com/zengm-games/facesjs).
   - Goals: Individual stats, skills, etc. updated dynamically based on race performance.
   - Goals: Maybe some news system, where the user can read AI-content generated by meet performeances, influenced by player personality.

5. **Dark Mode and Modern UI**
   - TailwindCSS-powered UI with dark mode support and a clean, customizable aesthetic.
   - Goals: Improve navigation of the game.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Next.JS
- **Database**: IndexedDB via [idb](https://github.com/jakearchibald/idb) for persistent storage.
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
- **Testing**: Jest for unit and integration testing.

## Game Mechanics

### Seasons and Phases

The game operates on a **yearly cycle**, broken into the following phases:

1. **Cross Country Season (Weeks 1–9)**:
   - Weekly meets where top 5 participants contribute to team scores.
   - Scoring favors lower times (1st place = 1 point).

2. **Playoffs (Weeks 10–11)**:
   - All teams start in the first round.
   - Winners advance based on team points in playoff meets until a champion is crowned.

3. **Offseason (Weeks 12–14)**:
   - End-of-season awards and team management.

4. **Track & Field Season (Weeks 15–39)**:
   - Weekly meets with track events.
   - Points awarded for top 6 finishers in each event.

5. **Track & Field Playoffs (Weeks 40–41)**:
   - Similar to cross country playoffs but based on track events.

6. **Final Offseason (Weeks 42–52)**:
   - End-of-season awards and team management.

## Future Plans
(Not in particularly any order)

- Allow players to customize the UI theme.
- Add player ratings to influence race outcomes
- Add player personality to influence player growth/decline
- Incorporate player stats, loyalty, and other factors into recruiting.
- Visualize races and track events week by week.
- Track training progress and implement skill growth.
