# Sim Game

Sim Game is a sports simulation web application inspired by games like *Basketball-GM* and *Out of the Park Baseball*. It focuses on managing and simulating university-level track & field and cross-country teams. Players recruit athletes, train them, and compete in events to achieve victory through strategic team management. (the title of the project is a WIP, as is the game.)

## Features

1. **Seasons and Playoffs**
   - Simulate cross-country and track and field events over the span of multiple seasons, including a realistic playoff schedule. 
   - Dynamic schedules with randomly generated meets and participant results.
   - Allow player ratings to influence race results
   - Goals: make schedules and race results be more realistic and life-like.

2. **Team and Player Management**
   - Goals: Allow the recruiting high school athletes to join your university team.
   - Goals: Allow holding tryouts, managing practice schedules, workouts, etc.
   - Allow a better UI for users to see their team statistics better

3. **Scoring Systems**
   - Cross-country: Top 5 finishers contribute to team scores. If a team doesn't have five racers, the team gets zero points, and players don't contribute to a scoring system.
   - Track & field: Points awarded by placement for top 6 participants.

4. **Player Profiles**
   - Randomly generated cartoon faces for players using [faces.js](https://github.com/zengm-games/facesjs).
   - Goals: Individual stats, skills, etc. updated dynamically based on race performance.
   - Goals: Maybe some news system, where the user can read content generated by meet performances, influenced by player personality.

5. **UI/UX**
   - Dark mode support
   - Game sidebar and main header navigation.

## Game Mechanics

### Seasons and Phases

The game operates on a **yearly cycle**, broken into the following phases:

1. **Cross Country Season (Weeks 1–9)**:
   - Weekly meets where the top five participants contribute to team scores. (top 7 participants are counted as "pushers")
   - Scoring favors lower times (first place = 1 point).

2. **Playoffs (Weeks 10–11)**:
   - All teams start in the first round.
   - Winners advance based on team points in playoff meets until a champion is crowned.

3. **Offseason (Weeks 12–14)**:
   - End-of-season awards and team management.

4. **Track & Field Season (Weeks 15–39)**:
   - Weekly meets with track events.
   - Points are awarded for the top 6 finishers in each event.

5. **Track & Field Playoffs (Weeks 40–41)**:
   - Similar to cross-country playoffs but based on track events.

6. **Final Offseason (Weeks 42–52)**:
   - End-of-season awards and team management.

## Plans
(Not in particularly any order)

- Improve player rating distribution
- Add more player interaction (players to manage who they send to meets, how many racers on their team, budgeting, etc.)
- Add player personality to influence player growth/decline
- Incorporate player stats, loyalty, and other factors into recruiting.
- Visualize races and track events week by week.
- Track training progress and implement skill growth.
- Improve meet scheduling (host teams, meet names, season awards)
